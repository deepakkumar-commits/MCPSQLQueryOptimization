SQL Query Optimization Architecture with Model Context Protocol 

SQL Query Optimization with MCP Basic Example
This is a basic example of how  Model Context Protocol (MCP) can be used for SQL query optimization. It demonstrates core functionality including tools and resources.

MCP Architecture for SQL Query Optimization

Server-Side Components

The MCP server architecture consists of several key components working in harmony:

Core Framework
•	FastMCP Server: Handles protocol communication and request routing
•	Database Connection Class: Manages database connectivity across different engines
•	Dialect Support: Adapts to various SQL dialects (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, etc.)

MCP Tools Suite
The optimization workflow encompasses seven distinct tools: 
•	Table Extractor: Identifies tables and relationships from SQL queries 
•	Complexity Analyzer: Evaluates query complexity and resource requirements 
•	Execution Plan Generator: Creates and analyzes query execution plans 
•	Index Advisor: Recommends optimal indexing strategies 
•	Join Optimizer: Suggests join reordering and optimization 
•	Performance Predictor: Estimates query performance metrics 
•	Report Consolidator: Generates comprehensive optimization recommendations

External Dependencies
•	Language Model Integration: Connects with OpenAI, Anthropic, and other LLM providers
•	Database Connectors: Supports multiple database engines and cloud platforms
